    "description": "As a senior developer, I handled diverse responsibilities to build and scale this platform. I engineered the administrative dashboard (AssetOS) using Filament and developed core logic for the user parking app (including 'series booking,' analytics, and Leaflet.js maps). A key focus was utility optimization (contingent sharing/pooling) and integrating diverse third-party cloud APIs. This included interfacing with major parking hardware systems via the Scheidt & Bachmann (entervo) API for live barrier control, and integrating ChargeX EV chargers for charging data.",
